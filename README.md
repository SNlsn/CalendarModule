# Calendar Test

This project is a test. It's intention is to work out issues with the calendar and event creation aspect of a larger scheduling and client management app I'm developing for my small photo business.

A previous version used the bokmann fullcalendar-assets gem, but I want to avoid that since I don't know if that project will be updated when the FullCalendar jQuery project gets updated. I'd rather give up some convenience in exchange for knowing I can update FullCalendar.

I'm currently dissatisfied with datetimepickers available. I'm leaning toward just a simple text field, parsed via the Chronic library.
